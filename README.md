# Sites Using Bot
This slack bot uses nodejs, mongodb, botkit and more to help answer the common question on Miva's slack channels 'Does anyone know any websites using X software?'. It holds a database and loosely searches for matches when asked, or allows users in the channels to update it's list of examples. Currently running on Heroku.
